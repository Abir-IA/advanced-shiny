# Facebook login through JavaScript in Shiny

*Dean Attali, July 2015*

This app shows how you can use the AJAX-like system in Shiny to authorize a user using Facebook's JavaScript library and pass the user's information to R for processing. Because of Facebook's app settings, in order for the app to work properly locally, you need to replace `127.0.0.1` with `fuf.me`.
